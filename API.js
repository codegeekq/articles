    article: 'Welcome to our final lesson in the HTML tutorial. In this lesson, we will delve into the world of basic HTML tags. <br> In this concluding lesson, we are going to create a small application to review fundamental HTML tags and comprehend how to utilize them in real-world projects. <br> Now, what is the idea behind the application? We will be building a TODO APP. This project type aids in organizing and planning tasks you intend to undertake. <br> Before we commence, I would like to share some insights about the project. In this venture, we will need to incorporate JavaScript and CSS. However, for this lesson, we will focus solely on establishing the HTML structure of the project. <br> The remaining CSS and JavaScript codes can be found in the final lesson of the JavaScript tutorial, where you can download the entire project and modify it to enhance the design. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out to me via email. <br> Now, let us dive into explaining the code. <iframe src="./proj.html" style="width:100%;height:500px;border-radius: 15px;border:1px solid gray" frameborder="0"></iframe><br><br> When crafting your own websites, it is advisable to leverage semantic HTML to sidestep potential issues and make the development process smoother in the long run. When collaborating with a team on any project, precision in code writing is crucial to ensure it is understandable to team members throughout the development process. <br> As you write code, you should be cognizant of the programming logic you aim to traverse during site development and have a plan for what you want to achieve over time in developing this site, regardless of its scale. <br> Now, I will elucidate why I utilized certain tags in the above code. For instance, by using the "input" tag, I employed it to gather user input. <br> I created a button to submit the data entered in the input, saving it for later review in the todo list. I prefer organizing the code by encapsulating each part within a div item to facilitate the development experience for myself. Lastly, let us delve into HTML attributes. <br> Attributes in HTML are among the most pivotal elements for executing actions on your site, such as creating links to navigate to other pages or sites, among various actions that elevate your site‘s sophistication. Here are some examples of HTML attributes: To style any HTML element on your page, you can easily employ the<code> style="" </code>attribute and directly write CSS code within it. Another example, if you wish to create a link for navigation between site pages, you can use the <a> tag, include the <code> href="" </code >attribute, and specify the page target in double quotes, and we’re done. I hope you derive benefit from this lesson, and remember, when you feel a lack of motivation, never give up. <br> <br> This tutorial has concluded.

So , where we can writing the CSS codes ? Here we have several answers : we can write CSS between the <code> &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; </code> tags , or we can write it in the <code> style="" </code> attribute to make inline style , but you should know something about this , the properties you write in the tag attributes make overwrite for any property wrote in any where in your project for this element . And the last place you can write CSS codes is to write them in an external file that you can link to the HTML file via the link code. <br> So , we learned where we can write the CSS codes , now what is the CSS properties? The CSS properties are among the most important things that you should learn in this language because it enables you to control the properties of HTML element sush as shape, length, width and font size in it, and other things that you can use to provide a very creative and wonderful product.<br> This table contains most of the properties in CSS .   <br> <br> <h5 class="headers">CSS 3 Properties & Usage</h5> <br> <iframe src="./css properties.html" width = "100%" height = "1000px" frameborder="0"></iframe>  <br> ` ,
